//Slightly more informative drone infos

//Healing -> mention 5s duration
//Transport -> mention 400% flat damage
//Junk -> Mention specifics and cooldown

//Emergency -> Written as 250% instead of 50%/s to match other drones, 5s duration
//Cleanup -> Radius, slow%

//Jailer -> Utiltiy not damage (not important)
//Barrier -> 5s duration

//Bombard -> Mention 16x shocks
//Freeze -> 2s freeze duration



//Arrow Rain : Wrong DPS
//Desperado : Write 60% to be more easily understood. (It's 10% TOTAL damage, which results in 60% flat)
//Engi Turret : It deals 70% per shot for 200% dps, so 100% is wrong either way.
//Power Mode: 50% slow, not 60%
//Weak: -30 Armor, not -20%
//Shadow Fade: Heals for a strange 18.2%, not 25%

//Boosted Oil Spill: They forgot to give it a different description
