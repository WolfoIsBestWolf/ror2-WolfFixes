The following bugs are fixed:
```
- Treeborn Canopy   Radar Scanner being blocked by Aphelian Sanctuary Log.
- Golden Dieback    Radar Scanner being blocked by Aphelian Sanctuary Log.

- Bulwarks Ambry 02  	Uses Bulwarks Ambry 01 DLC1 monster spawn pool instead of its own.
- Shattered Abodes  	Has Stage 1 Overgrown Printers. Which Stage 1s are not meant to have.

- Simu-Sanctuary & Simu-Commencement not being able to spawn Lunar Buds which would still take credits.

- Lunar Golems being unable to spawn unless there is a Ceiling. (Bad for Dissonance, strange in general)
```

The other changes are not necessarily bugs, some can be disabled.

SotV removing/replacing enemies might come back, might stay gone.\
People have been asking the devs about it a lot, they are aware of it.
 


```
Reduced weight of Titanic Plains and Distant Roost because they count as 2 stages.
-Vanilla counts as 2 weight, now counts as 1.5 weight.

Limits Radar Scanners & Altar of Gold to 1 per stage.
Makes Radar Scanner more likely to spawn.

Lunar Seers will no longer get Pre-Loop stage variants during loops.

ReAdded SotV removing some enemies, because the new enemies were seemingly meant as replacements.
If DLC1 is enabled :
- Jellyfish removed from Loop Titanic Plains : Replaced with Alpha Construct 
- Lemurian removed from Rallypoint Delta     : Replaced with Blind Vermin
- Lesser Wisp removed from Rallypoint Delta  : Replaced with Blind Pest
- Greater Wisp removed from Abyssal Depths   : Replaced with Gup
- Beetle removed from Sirens Call            : Replaced with Larva
- Lemurian removed from Sundered Grove       : Replaced with Larva
- Elder Lemurian removed from Sundered Grove : Replaced with Gup
